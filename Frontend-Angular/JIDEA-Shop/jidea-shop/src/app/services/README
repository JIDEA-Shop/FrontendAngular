This folder contains a couple Microservices.

Services have the following Convention:

XService , Xhttp , and implX.

To use a Service, please inject implX into the respective component's constructor.

EX: constructor(marketingservice : impl-marketing) gives marketing information

From there, you have to pull data from the service. This can be achieved in the
constructor as well and is stored in the service's collection. Each Service
contains a collection field which stores information. From here, you can build
a local collection to the field and implement any methods you prefer.


Ex:

constructor(marketingservice : impl-marketing) {

  // The assumption is that the Service is Running and has array.
    marketingservice.DisplayCatalog().subscribe()

}
